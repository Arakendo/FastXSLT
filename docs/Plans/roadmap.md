# FastXSLT Roadmap

The roadmap is ordered by executable semantic evidence, not by a desire to fill
every conceptual module. Dates are intentionally absent until requirements and
standards scope are decided.

## Current critical path

FastXSLT has accepted its staged-modern semantic direction and passes the
complete XSLT30 `template`, `path`, and `expr/for` test-set denominators. It also
executes the complete four-case QT3 `Axes002` group through a
stylesheet-independent XPath seam. `for-004` closes its family through
bound-variable attribute paths, checked exact-decimal multiplication and
aggregation, and the single required two-decimal formatting picture. The
current order of work is:

1. extend the bounded-concurrency isolated ASP.NET experiment with natural
   unpaused cancellation measurements, broader diagnostic parity, and
   representative workload evidence; pre-dispatch and deterministic active
   cooperative cancellation, worker
   failure/restart, explicit snapshot generation promotion, and changed-resource
   file replacement now have private executable baselines;
2. prototype the leading in-process .NET boundary against the same lifecycle;
3. compare both modes before stabilizing a host boundary or performance claim.

Representative consumer transforms are not a prerequisite for a testable
standards-driven preview. The pinned W3C suites provide executable stylesheets,
sources, dependency metadata, environments, assertions, and expected errors and
can drive incremental implementation now. Consumer examples remain necessary
to prioritize optional compatibility, validate useful workload coverage, choose
host-facing lifecycle details, and make ASP.NET or application-performance
claims.

ADR-0006 now makes AR-0011's essential ledger invariants binding. Its remaining
reporting, storage, CI, and comparison-family work proceeds when executable
standards slices need it; those deferred choices are not the current release
gate. AR-0005 and AR-0010 remain seam-preservation reviews. Compatibility AR-0006
and streaming AR-0007 are deferred unless a representative case activates one
of their reopening pressures.

## M0 -- Project scaffold

- [x] Buildable Rust workspace with formatting, lint, test, and docs gates.
- [x] Documentation authority and lifecycle established.
- [x] Initial SDD, ADR process, AR process, and testing strategy established.
- [x] Golden corpus layout seeded without claiming executable support.

Exit criterion: a clean checkout can run the local verification script and the
next architectural questions are visible rather than encoded accidentally.

## M1 -- Standards decision and first vertical slice

- [ ] Record representative transform families, input/output shapes, and
  compatibility needs from the first intended consumer before claiming product
  fit or selecting host/performance defaults; this does not block the
  standards-driven preview.
- [x] Close AR-0001 through accepted ADR-0007.
- [x] Select and document the leading private XML parser boundary for the slice.
- [x] Compile one root template, evaluate one path/value expression, and produce
  one result through a private end-to-end engine path.
- [x] Run `corpus/golden/hello` with private structured failure identities.
- [x] Load the golden source and stylesheet through a bounded resource set,
  seal it, and execute the case without engine-owned filesystem access.
- [x] Release import handles before sealing, then replace or remove the original
  fixture files and prove the snapshot still executes identically.
- [x] Add negative cases that distinguish invalid input from unsupported syntax.
- [x] Establish the first private structured boundary failures and reportable semantic
  outcomes from emitted behavior rather than an aspirational error catalog,
  providing evidence for AR-0004.
- [x] Preserve native QT3/XSLT30 case identity, separate selection from
  execution disposition, reject unknown metadata visibly, and conserve report
  denominators through a private AR-0011 experiment.

Exit criterion: the seed transform passes through the intended layers and every
implemented behavior belongs to a named standards slice.

## M2 -- Data model and XPath foundation

- [ ] Define node identity, document order, names, strings, and sequence/value
  behavior needed by the accepted profile.
- [x] Record the navigation and retention capabilities the implemented XPath
  and XSLT slice actually requires; keep tree-specific random-access assumptions
  inside their physical owner, providing evidence for AR-0007.
- [ ] Expand XPath lex/parse/evaluate tests before growing XSLT instructions.
- [x] Admit all ten cases in the complete XSLT30 `path` test set and execute
  `path-001` through `path-010`, including charged axis predicates, per-step
  positions, `last()`, checked constant-integer arithmetic, integer-domain
  `floor()`, and the native complex relative match pattern.
- [x] Execute the complete QT3 `Axes002` named-child-axis group through native
  environments, direct XPath, `fn:count`, charged navigation, and `assert-eq`
  comparison without an XSLT wrapper.
- [x] Admit all four XSLT30 `expr/for` cases with their native environments,
  stylesheets, entry metadata, XML assertions, and explicit unsupported
  dispositions before implementing sequence semantics.
- [x] Execute native `for-001` through ordered distinct-value binding,
  comparison/path selection, source-node identity preservation, and
  `xsl:sequence` result construction against its complete upstream assertion.
- [x] Execute source-free native `for-002` through an invocation-local
  initial-template entry, ordered integer bindings/addition, an independently
  bounded XPath-operation domain, and `xsl:value-of` separator semantics.
- [x] Execute native `for-003` with the outer focus preserved across its
  binding, empty-sequence multiplication, and the integer zero result of
  `sum(())`, while refusing non-empty numeric multiplication.
- [x] Execute native `for-004` with bound-variable attribute navigation,
  checked exact-decimal multiplication and aggregation, and only the required
  `'0.00'` formatting picture. The complete four-case denominator now passes.
- [x] Admit the complete nine-case XSLT30 `expr/castable` denominator: seven
  selected cases, two explicit schema-aware profile exclusions, four
  admission-time engine gaps, and three harness gaps.
- [x] Execute native `castable-001` through controlled atomization and owned
  built-in lexical castability, retaining inherited prefixed namespaces on its
  literal result. The selected denominator is one pass, three engine gaps, and
  three harness gaps.
- [x] Execute native `castable-002` through explicit built-in casts and typed
  invocation-local variables. The selected denominator is two passes, two
  engine gaps, and three harness gaps.
- [x] Execute native `castable-003` through an explicit value-aware conversion
  matrix for boolean, integer, decimal, float, and double. The selected
  denominator is three passes, one engine gap, and three harness gaps.
- [x] Execute native `castable-004` through explicit duration-family
  castability and its inline XML assertion. The selected denominator is four
  passes, no engine-classified gaps, and three harness gaps.
- [ ] Establish diagnostic codes and source spans across XML and XPath phases.
- [x] Provide a read-only semantic inspection snapshot for the implemented
  compilation slice without exposing private parser, arena, or IR types,
  providing evidence for AR-0005.
- [x] Import the first licensed, versioned, integrity-checked suite selection.

Exit criterion: a published test report identifies supported, unsupported,
failed, and harness-error cases without an unqualified conformance claim.

## M3 -- Reusable stylesheet engine

- [x] Separate reusable compiled stylesheet state from dynamic transform state
  in the private reference path; its public representation remains unstabilized.
- [ ] Add template selection, built-in rules, parameters, variables, and output
  behavior required by the accepted profile.
- [x] Execute XSLT30 `template-001` through built-in document dispatch,
  comment-node selection, and an isolated named mode while retaining the other
  four unsupported cases in the six-case denominator.
- [x] Execute XSLT30 `template-002/003` through processing-instruction and
  general child-node tests, retaining mode isolation and exact-pattern
  precedence. Four of the six denominator cases now pass.
- [x] Execute XSLT30 `template-004` through attribute-axis selection and an
  exact attribute pattern without adding attributes to the child axis. Five of
  the six denominator cases now pass.
- [x] Execute XSLT30 `template-005` through statically resolved named templates,
  invocation-local parameters, conditional equality, calls, and bounded
  recursion. The complete six-case denominator now passes.
- [ ] Establish explicit URI/resource resolution and execution limits.
- [x] Execute a private batch of independent requests with shared compiled stylesheets
  and isolated dynamic contexts; randomize scheduling, correlate results by
  identity, and prove a batch of one matches the convenience API.
- [x] Compare parse-per-invocation with private snapshot/work-generation prepared
  input reuse, reporting retained XDM and peak construction memory separately.
- [x] Measure parse, XDM construction, compilation, compiled/direct execution,
  compiled/prepared execution, compile-per-invocation execution, retained XDM,
  and preparation peak memory over native XSLT30 `for-004` and `castable-004`.
- [x] Execute a two-stage host-owned workflow and prove stage-one results remain
  invisible until explicitly admitted into a stage-two snapshot.
- [ ] Compare file-per-call, preloaded snapshot, warmed filesystem cache, and
  compile-once paths with correctness held constant.
- [ ] Add differential and integration tests against named processors.
  - [x] Establish a small ASP.NET comparison against Microsoft's built-in XSLT
    1.0 processor and a locally acquired, non-distributed SaxonCS-HE 13.0.0
    adapter, preserving exact-stylesheet versus equivalent-workload distinctions.
- [ ] Run an ASP.NET consumer workbench through the selected host boundary,
  reusing compiled stylesheets across requests with explicit cancellation and
  resource policy.
  - [x] Establish the first ASP.NET 8 persistent isolated-worker baseline with
    one-time bounded resource transfer, compile-once/prepared reuse, correlated
    results, structured failures, and one explicit in-flight slot.
  - [x] Exercise deterministic 5-, 50-, and 500-item tiers through a bounded
    four-worker pool, recording throughput, p50/p95/p99 latency, CPU,
    allocation, working-set scope, result size, and comparison-engine caveats.
  - [x] Terminate an acknowledged non-cooperating isolated request without
    poisoning a sibling, decline ambiguous retry, replace only its worker slot,
    and promote/drain explicitly identified snapshot generations.
  - [x] Import and close host files, replace them while an old generation lease
    remains active, and prove old/new requests retain their sealed source
    semantics without engine-owned filesystem access.
  - [x] Carry already-signalled cooperative cancellation into an isolated
    invocation, preserve its exact direct-path diagnostic, and reuse the same
    worker generation; natural active-signal measurement remains open.
  - [x] Route a correlated cancellation while execution is paused at a real
    charge point, ignore an unrelated identity, preserve structured failure and
    worker reuse, and keep the artificial barrier out of latency claims.
- [ ] Exercise AR-0010's private invocation controls under adversarial work;
  distinguish deterministic budgets, cooperative cancellation, best-effort
  deadlines, panic handling, and process-level hard termination claims.

Exit criterion: representative stylesheets compile once, transform multiple
documents without leaked state, fail through structured diagnostics, and expose
measured end-to-end behavior to at least one non-Rust consumer.

## Later candidates

CLI, WASM, streaming implementation or conformance, schema awareness, extension
functions, packages, alternate execution backends, transformation graphs, and
specific parallel executor strategies require their own product evidence and
architectural review. Their presence in this list is not a commitment.
